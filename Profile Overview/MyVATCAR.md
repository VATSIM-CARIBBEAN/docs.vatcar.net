## Profile

This is your landing page. You will be shown your name, email address that is associated with VATSIM, your current rating, your current visiting ratio, and your current facility in VATCAR.

The visiting ratio shows how many hours you have controlled at your home facility from your total number of hours in the last 90 days. You must maintain less than 50% per the Global Controller Administration Policy.

You can see your last 5 connections to VATSIM as an air traffic controller as well as your total hours based on each rating.
