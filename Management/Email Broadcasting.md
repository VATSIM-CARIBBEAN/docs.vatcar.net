# Email Broadcasting

This page will allow you to draft an email and send it to a facility or division. This will also send a broadcast to all members said facility as a notification on the website. This will __NOT__ bypass the notification selection for each user's setting. However, if you select "ALL WEBSITE MEMBERS," this **WILL** bypass GDPR and send an email to all members. This should only be used in special cases only. Most facility management will not have access to this option.

!!!danger Danger
Selecting `ALL WEBSITE MEMBERS` will **BYPASS GDPR.** Use only if absolutely necessary.

!!!info Info
If the user's are not subscribed to e-mail notifications, they will only receive a broadcast notification on the website.
