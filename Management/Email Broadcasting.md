# Email Broadcasting

This page will allow you to draft an email and send it to a facility or division. This will also send a broadcast to all members said facility as a notification on the website. This will __NOT__ bypass the notification selection for each user's setting. However, if you select "ALL WEBSITE MEMBERS," this **WILL** bypass GDPR and send an email to all members. This should only be used in special cases only. Most facility management will not have access to this option.
