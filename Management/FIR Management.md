# FIR Management

This page gives you access to your specific FIR's management page. Depending on your role, you may only have access to what you have authority over. There are 11 tabs on each management page (excluding Caribbean FSS and Hit Squad, they only have 10.) We will go through what each tab contains and how to operate them.

## Home

This tab will show you the number of active controllers you have, current pending transfer and visitor requests. You can always access this page to get a glimpse of whether there are current applications available.

## Controllers

This is your current roster. You can see all your home and visiting controllers. The roster shows whether they are active, join date, and other necessary information. Based on your role in the FIR, you will have access to different controller actions. They are as follows:

1. View Controller
    - This navigates you to the member management page where you can see the controller information. This is an alternate to typing their CID in the member management page.
2. Training Notes
    - This navigates you to the member's training notes page.
3. Add Instructor
    - Only individuals with an Instructor rating can be added as an instructor. This will mark them as an FIR instructor.
4. Add Mentor
    - This will mark the member as an FIR mentor. They are not required to hold an Instructor rating.
5. Remove
    - This will start the removal process of the member. You will have to fill out a reason in order to remove them from the FIR.
