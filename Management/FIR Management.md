# FIR Management

This page gives you access to your specific FIR's management page. Depending on your role, you may only have access to what you have authority over. There are 11 tabs on each management page (excluding Caribbean FSS and Hit Squad, they only have 10.) We will go through what each tab contains and how to operate them.

## Home

This tab will show you the number of active controllers you have, current pending transfer and visitor requests. You can always access this page to get a glimpse of whether there are current applications available.

## Controllers

This is your current roster. You can see all your home and visiting controllers. The roster shows whether they are active, join date, and other necessary information. Based on your role in the FIR, you will have access to different controller actions. They are as follows:

1. View Controller
    - This navigates you to the member management page where you can see the controller information. This is an alternate to typing their CID in the member management page.
2. Training Notes
    - This navigates you to the member's training notes page.
3. Add Instructor
    - Only individuals with an Instructor rating can be added as an instructor. This will mark them as an FIR instructor.
4. Add Mentor
    - This will mark the member as an FIR mentor. They are not required to hold an Instructor rating.
5. Remove
    - This will start the removal process of the member. You will have to fill out a reason in order to remove them from the FIR.

## Endorsements

This is your endorsement management page for your controllers. You can add or remove endorsements for each controller based on GCAP. If you need to add a specific endorsement that is not included, you can do so manually. By default, when assigning an endorsement, it will take their current rating and endorse them for that facility. For example, endorsing a Controller 1 for Tier 1 will endorse them for "CTR" positions on Tier 1 facilities.

## Training

The training tab has two subsections, Students and Recent History.

### Students

You can view all your home facility members on this page. You can assign an instructor to a student which will notify the student that they have been assigned an instructor. Additionally, you have the option to remove the current instructor assigned.

### Recent History

This page will show recent training notes and recent exam results for all your students. They will show who was their instructor so that you can keep track of what is going on.

## Activity

You are able to see all your controller's activity within the past **rolling 90 days**. A controller will be marked active if they have controlled a minimum of 3 hours within the aforementioned timeframe. Additionally, you are able to see their visiting ratio. Per GCAP, all controllers must maintain less than 50%, meaning the total number of hours visited must be less than 50% of their total controlled hours. It is the responsibility of the FIR to ensure their members meet this criteria. Additionally, you can access their VATSIM stats profile by clicking the eye icon under Actions.

## Transfers

You will find all pending transfer requests here. Based on their application, you have the ability to accept or deny their request.

## Visitor Requests

You will find all pending visitor requests here. Based on their application, you have the ability to accept or deny their request.

## Staff Management

This page allows Air Traffic Managers to assign roles to their members. This will grant the member access to the management page with respect to their role. You are able to vacate your role through this page as well.

## Web Configuration

This page allows you to change your website URL as well as the facility description that is shown to everybody under the FIR tab. The API Keys will allow your webmasters to access certain API endpoints available to you from VATCAR.

## Facility Callsigns

This page is where you manage all your controlled facility's callsigns. In order for the activity tracker to work properly, you must ensure that your controlled facility's callsigns are listed on this page. To create a new callsign, you will only have to enter the facility prefix, removing anything after the underscore (_). Additionally, you have to enter the type of facility, whether it is an Airport, Flight Service Station, or Center facility. An airport would be for facilities ranging from Delivery (DEL) to Approach/Departure (APP/DEP).

## Welcome Email

This page will allow you to customize the welcome email that is automatically sent to members that have been accepted into the facility. Be sure to be as detailed as possible ensuring your new members know what the next steps are so that they will not be confused!

## Files

This button will redirect you to the documents page where you can add or edit your facility documents or files. You will want to add your sector files and all other necessary data your controllers will need.
