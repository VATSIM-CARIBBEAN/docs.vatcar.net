# Event Management

All event managers have access to this page. This will allow them to create a new event on VATCAR. Be sure to select appropriate facilities that have the ability to manage this event.

## Editing an Event

Selecting an event under "Your Planned Events" will lead you to the editing page. There is an additional category called "Available Positions." This allows you to create positions in the roster for your controllers to be able to sign up for.

!!!warning WARNING
Currently, positions listed here will appear for all facilities selected under manage facilities. 
!!!

To view the roster, you will have to navigate to the events tab and select the respective event. Below the event information, you will see a roster for each facility that you are a controller in. Facility and Division staff have the ability to remove other controllers from a position and shift. Each controller can sign up for multiple position and shifts.

!!!danger
The roster system is a work in progress and may not reflect accurately here.
