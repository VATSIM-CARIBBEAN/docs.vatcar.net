# My VATCAR

This is your individual profile. All VATCAR related systems that directly affect you is located in this page. You have three different categories on your sidebar:

1. My Settings
2. Training System
3. Self Service System

This documentation will go over each page that will guide you with necessary information you will need to navigate through.

## My Settings
### Profile

This is your landing page. You will be shown your name, email address that is associated with VATSIM, your current rating, your current visiting ratio, and your current facility in VATCAR.

The visiting ratio shows how many hours you have controlled at your home facility from your total number of hours in the last 90 days. You must maintain less than 50% per the Global Controller Administration Policy.

You can see your last 5 connections to VATSIM as an air traffic controller as well as your total hours based on each rating.

### Notifications

This is where you can view all your notifications, new or past. You will receive a notification when you have been assigned an exam, any updates to the exam, any updates to VATCAR documents, as well as any broadcasts from your facility or division staff. When you join a new facility, whether a visitor or home controller, you will be able to see all past notifications of that respective facility so that you may see recent updates.

### Email Preferences

By default, you will not receive any emails for most notifications. You can choose to opt-in to different e-mail categories you would like to receive. We recommend you select "Training" and your home facility to keep yourself updated with your training data as well as any important announcements from your facility.

## Training System

### CBTs - Computer Based Training

This is where you will find your computer based training data. To pick a facility's training syllabus, you can click on the dropdown menu at the top right. You will only be able to see facilities that you are at home or visiting.

The VCAC facility stands for VATCAR Academy. Prior to joining a facility, you will be asked to view **Block 1: WELCOME TO VATCAR**. The chapters will give you a general understanding of the Caribbean Division.

The first 4 blocks of each facility computer based training modules are restricted based on your rating. S1 controllers can access Block 1, S2 controllers can access Block 2, S3 controllers can access Block 3, and C1 controllers can access Blocks 4 and above. You may not skip chapters, as they must be completed in chronological order. The chapters will be marked done as you finish going through them. You will always be able to go back to any previous chapters.

### Exam Center

This is your hub for all exams you will take in VATCAR. If an instructor has assigned you an exam, it will show up here. You will be able to view your previous exams as well the score you have received. If you pass the exam, you will be able to review the questions and answers you have submitted.

Each exam has a deadline. Should you miss the deadline, you will not be able to take the exam and must be re-assigned. If you fail the exam, you are given a retake opportunity automatically, after a set number of days assigned by your instructor. By default, this is set to 3 days. Your instructor may re-assign the exam before the required number of days has passed.

If you are new to VATCAR, you will be prompted to complete the Entry Exam. A series of yes or no questions, this exam is your acknowledge of your understanding of VATCAR regulations as well as your intent to abide by them. You may only complete this exam after completing the Academy associated [computer based training](#cbts---computer-based-training).

## Self Service System

### Visiting Requests

For inter-division visiting requests, you can submit a form on this page. If you are eligible to visit, you will be able to fill out the form. If you are ineligible, the page will show you the criteria you fail to meet. Unfortunately, per the VATSIM GCAP, we will be unable to waive any of the criterias you do not meet.

### Transfer Requests

If you are looking to change your home facility, you can request to transfer on this page. If you meet the requirements to transfer, you will see a form in which you can select your intended facility and a description of why you want to transfer. If you do not meet the requirements, you will see a list of requirements as well as which criteria you fail to meet. Unfortunately, per the VATSIM GCAP, we will be unable to waive any of the criterias you do not meet.

### Support Requests

If you need help with anything related to VATCAR, you can always come here and open a new ticket. All VATSIM division staff members and facility air traffic managers can view your ticket and further assist you. While you have the option to individually email, opening a ticket allows multiple staff members that are capable to assist you, resulting in a better response time.

There is no such thing as a bad ticket!
