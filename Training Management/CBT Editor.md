# Computer Based Training Editor

This is where you will create your computer based training modules. You can navigate to your facility that you manage through the dropdown menu on the right side.

## Managing Blocks

To begin, you start by creating a new block.

!!!danger IMPORTANT NOTICE
Blocks 1 to 4 are restricted to S1 to C1 respectively. That means, Block 2 is not accessible to S1 students. Also, Block 2 will not be accessible to anyone if they have not completed Block 1. Chronological order matters!
!!!

After you create the block, you can toggle its visibility by clicking on the eye icon. Red means it will not be visible to students, while green will be. To edit the name of the block, you can click on the edit icon. If you need to change the order of the blocks, you can drag the rows.

## Managing Chapters

To begin editing the chapters, click on the name of the block. This will navigate you to the block editor page. All chapters are Google Slides based. You will need to fill in the title of the chapter, and then the link to the google slides embed. When you copy the google slides link, make sure to delete `editor` at the end of the link and replace it with `preview`. This will only show the slides to the student.

You can click and drag the rows to change the order of the chapters.

!!!warning Note
Students will be unable to proceed to the next chapter before completing the previous chapter. Chronological order matters!
